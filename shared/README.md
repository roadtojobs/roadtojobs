# The Interview Journey Shared

This contains code, libraries, helpers & utils that can be shared between web and server.

## Development

```bash
npm ci
npm run start
```

## Production

```bash
npm run build
```

## Notes

- `server` can automatically smell the changes
- `web` need to resync shared (rebuild then `npm ci` again)
